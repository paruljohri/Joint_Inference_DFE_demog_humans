# Here are scripts employed in the paper entitled "Developing an evolutionary baseline model for humans: jointly inferring purifying selection with population history".

Following is the description of the scripts that are present in each of thes folders:\

>> selecting_exons\
Scripts used to select the exons in the human genome to which our method was applied.

>>gene_conversion_simulations\
Simulations used to assess the importance of gene conversion rates in the recovery of diversity due to hitchhiking effects as a result of BGS and sweeps.

>> calculate_phase3_YRI_stats\
Scripts used to calculate the summary statistics form 50 YRI individuals from phase3 data. This includes obtaining the variants and the fasta files of the ancestral alleles in order to obtain polymorphism-based statistics and divergence respectively.

>> ABC\
-Simulations to perform ABC.\
-Calculation of statistics from simulated data.\
-Performing inference.\

>> simulations_with_mutation_rate_heterogeneity\
Scripts used to test how mutation rate heterogeneity across the genome can bias our inference method.

>>model_fit\
-assessing the fit of our best model to data\
-assessing the fit of the our best model with varying extent and frequency of recurrent positive selection.
